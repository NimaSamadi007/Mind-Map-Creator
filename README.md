# Mind-Map-Creator
A simple script creating mind-map graphs from a text file using graphviz

The `createMindMap.py` accpets a path to a `.txt` file and also an extra parameters defining the spacings between nodes of the graph (the larger the further nodes become). It uses `graphviz` to create the image. So, **make sure you have installed `graphviz`** in Python.

## How to Use?
After running the script, enter the following parameters:
```bash
> python createMindMap.py
Input rank sep parameter: 10
Input file path: raw-files/career.txt
career.dot file saved!
career.png file saved!
```
`career.dot` file is a `graphviz` specific format to define a graph. It's autogenerated from the input `.txt` file. The subject will be the file's name and the nodes are the lines of the file. Try to use newline characters in your raw file to get visually appleanig graphs. 

This is the result of running code:
![career.png file](./career.png)

I'm using this script to create mind-maps of topic-related concepts in English language.
## Reference
The code is developed based on `graphviz` documents and specifically [this tutorial](https://graphviz.org/Gallery/twopi/happiness.html).
